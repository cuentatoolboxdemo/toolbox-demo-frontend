## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: next-pwa for PWA — mature, minimal config for App Router
- [Setup]: localStorage for system prompt — simplest possible persistence for demo
- [Setup]: Hardcoded tenant map (calzedonia, sabores) — avoids dynamic routing complexity
- [Setup]: FormData for PDF upload — required by n8n file ingest endpoints
- [Setup]: OpenAI-style history format — predictable schema for n8n webhook parsing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Webhook URLs (chat inference + n8n ingest) are TBD — must be available before Phase 2/3 can be tested end-to-end. `.env.local` is the injection point.
